/**
 * Configuration for the Koffee toasts.
 *
 * @property layout The composable function to be used for the toast layout. It takes a [ToastData]
 * object as a parameter, which contains the data to be displayed in the toast.
 * @property dismissible A boolean value indicating whether the toast can be dismissed by the user.
 * If true, the toast can be dismissed by swiping it away.
 * @property durationResolver A function that resolves the duration of the toast. It takes a
 * [ToastDuration] object as a parameter and returns the duration in milliseconds. If null is
 * returned, the toast will be displayed indefinitely until dismissed by the user. The default
 * duration resolver uses the [defaultDurationResolver] function.
 * @property maxVisibleToasts The maximum number of toasts shown concurrently. Older toasts are
 * evicted when the limit is exceeded.
 * @property position The screen position where toasts will be displayed (e.g., BottomCenter).
 * @property animationStyle The enter/exit animation direction for toasts (e.g., SlideUp/SlideDown).
 *
